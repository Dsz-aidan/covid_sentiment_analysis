# covid_sentiment_analysis
Performing sentiment analysis on COVID-19 lockdown tweets in the USA. Utilized NLP techniques and ML algorithms, with Naive Bayes achieving optimal results. Built a user-friendly web app for real-time analysis.

This project focuses on conducting sentiment analysis on Twitter data to understand public sentiment during the COVID-19 lockdown in the United States. 
The dataset was filtered to include tweets specific to the USA, and sentiments were assigned using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model. 
Various machine learning algorithms were evaluated, with Naive Bayes ultimately yielding the best performance. 
The project also includes a Flask-based web application for user-friendly sentiment analysis based on input keywords. 
The code and resources in this repository provide a comprehensive case study on sentiment analysis in the context of a major global event.
